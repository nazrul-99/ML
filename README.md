# ML Toolkit & Projects: Learning through Experimentation

### Machine Learning Projects Collection
Welcome to my repository of machine learning experiments and projects! This collection features a variety of classic and advanced ML algorithms I have explored over time, including:

- Clustering Models: DBSCAN, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- Classification Models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Regression Models: Linear Regression, House Price Prediction
 Deep Learning & Computer Vision: Fashion MNIST, OpenCV projects
- Stock Market Prediction: GP Stock Prediction, Dhaka Stock Exchange
- Recommendation Systems: Personalized recommended system

Each project includes code, datasets (where applicable), and README files explaining the objectives and results. These projects served as a learning platform to understand different algorithms and their practical applications.

Feel free to explore, run the notebooks or scripts.
